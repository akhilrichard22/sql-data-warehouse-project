## 📂 Project Overview

- **Data Sources**: CRM and ERP datasets provided in CSV format.  
- **Data Warehouse**: Implemented in **SQL Server Express**.  
- **ETL Pipelines**: Built using SQL scripts for cleansing and transformation.  
- **Data Model**: Final data organized into fact and dimension tables for analysis.  
- **Analytics**: SQL queries to generate insights into customers, products, and sales.
