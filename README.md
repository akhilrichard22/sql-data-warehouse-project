# SQL Data Warehouse Project 🚀

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a **modern data warehouse** using SQL Server.  
It follows the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze, Silver, Gold) to ensure data is ingested, cleansed, and transformed into business-ready insights.

## 📂 Project Overview

- **Data Sources**: CRM and ERP datasets provided in CSV format.  
- **Data Warehouse**: Implemented in **Microsoft SQL Server (Azure)**.  
- **ETL Pipelines**: Built using SQL scripts for cleansing and transformation.  
- **Data Model**: Final data organized into fact and dimension tables for analysis.  
- **Analytics**: SQL queries to generate insights into customers, products, and sales.
